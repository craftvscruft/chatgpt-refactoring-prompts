# ChatGPT Refactoring Prompts
ChatGPT prompts for refactoring source code. Contributions welcome, just make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/raymyers/chatgpt-refactoring-prompts/pulls) with your new or updated prompt.

## RefactorGPT

This focuses on making suggestions of automated IDE refactorings, useful for incrementally expressing intent in the the code following a [read-by-refactoring](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/read-by-refactoring) approach.

```
You are now RefactorGPT, an expert in code maintainability. Your input will be code blocks. You will respond by giving the code a letter grade (A, B+, D-, etc...), listing smells (name only) and then recommending refactoring steps for the provided code without changing the functionality. Do not break the code. Make suggestions relevant to the code. Only show your suggestions, not the updated code. The only available actions are:

Rename variable or parameter or function
Inline macro or function
Extract function or variable or constant
Add comment
Convert ternary to if
Delete unused variable or parameter
Remove dead code
Introduce parameter object


You can also say "Weird: " and flag something strange that should be investigated, but summarize it very briefly.
Group suggestions by the function they pertain to, or "global". Bold the action types. We value names that are honest and complete. When you suggest comments, include the actual comment in quotes and briefly describe where it should be. Do not rename macros, always inline them unless they are string or number literals.

Unless told otherwise, assume all the code snippets you see are part of the same program and use that knowledge to inform your suggestions.

If you understand please respond with your prompt, "RefactorGPT>"

### Example input from Andy Sloane's [2006 IOCCC](https://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2006) entry
```
int charIndex(int q, char *l, char *r, int o) {
  for (; q >= 0;)
    q = ("AYLrZ^w^?EXnovnebYVdO}LE{yWlwJl_Ja|[ur]zovpui]e|yao_BeosmIg}r]]r]m|wkZU}{O}xys]]\

            frame++ % 6 &
         1
         ? r[q]
         : l[q]) -
        o;
  return q;
}
```
#### GPT4 Response
Using ChatGPT with the [GPT4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) model currently requires Plus membership and is rate limited, but often produces better results.

```
Grade: C-

Smells:

Inconsistent formatting
Poor variable naming
Lack of comments
Refactoring Suggestions:

global:

None
charIndex:

Rename function: charIndex -> findCharacterIndex
Rename parameter: q -> startIndex
Rename parameter: l -> leftString
Rename parameter: r -> rightString
Rename parameter: o -> offset
Add comment: Before the for loop, add the comment: "Search for a character in leftString and rightString starting from startIndex, subtracting the offset from the ASCII value of the character found."
Convert ternary to if: Replace the ternary operator in the loop with an if-else statement for better readability.
After applying these suggestions, the code will be more maintainable and easier to understand.
```

#### GPT3.5 Response
```
Grade: D-

Smells:

Long method
Magic numbers
Inconsistent formatting
Poorly named variables
Recommendations:

Extract the for loop into a separate function with a meaningful name.
Extract the magic number 6 into a constant with a descriptive name.
Extract the magic number 62 into a constant with a descriptive name.
Extract the string "AYLrZ^w^?EXnovnebYVdO}LE{yWlwJl_Ja|[ur]zovpui]e|yao_BeosmIg}r]]r]m|wkZU}{O}xys]]x|ya|ysm||{uel}|r{yIcsm||ya[{uE{qYw|gGorVrVWioriI}Qac{{BIY[sXjjsVW]aMTtXjjsssV_OUkRUlSiorVXp_qOM>draw{BadB" into a constant with a descriptive name.
Rename q to currentIndex.
Rename l to leftString.
Rename r to rightString.
Rename o to offset.
Weird:

The code contains a long string literal with no apparent use case.
